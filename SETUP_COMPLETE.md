## 🚨 Enforcement Strategy

### If You Discover Unauthorized Use

**Step 1: Gather Evidence**
- Screenshot the violation
- Document the copied patterns
- Save all relevant URLs/repos
- Note the date of discovery

**Step 2: Friendly Contact (Recommended First)**
```
Subject: Unauthorized Use of Swarm-Tech Protected Patterns

Hello [Name],

I noticed your project [link] appears to use architectural patterns
from Swarm-Tech (https://github.com/sepullupes/Swarm-Tech).

Specifically, I see similarities in:
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]

These patterns are proprietary and protected under the Swarm-Tech
Proprietary License. Commercial use requires a license.

I'd like to discuss licensing options that work for both of us.
Would you be available for a brief call this week?

Best regards,
Ahmad Syaiful Bin Rusli

**Step 3: Formal Cease & Desist (If Needed)**
- Consult a Malaysian IP lawyer
- Send formal legal notice
- Demand removal or licensing
- Set deadline (usually 14-30 days)

**Step 4: Legal Action (Last Resort)**
- File in Malaysian courts
- Seek injunction and damages
- Recover attorney fees
- Establish precedent

## 💰 Monetization Ideas

Now that your IP is protected, you can:

### 4. **Dual Licensing**
